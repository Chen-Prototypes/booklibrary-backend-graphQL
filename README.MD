# Shelf Schema Backend

## [Shelf Schema Web App](https://shelf-schema.fly.dev/)

This is my backend to my personal book library built with Apollo Server and GraphQL. Features real-time data subscriptions using WebSockets, backed by MongoDB, and deployed on Fly.io. Also includes an React frontend interface with Material UI styling.
